    <div id="bio">For this video, I had a summer vibe going on through my head. I wanted the viewers to experience what I was thinking of and what song was on repeat for me during each day
      that went by during the semester. I took the theme of daydreaming into my mind because I kept daydreaming about what I wanted to do during the summer. The main message is to see what
      the audience at whatever location they are at can resemble themselves within this perspective if they were at a relaxing place or on vacation.
      The program that I had used to make this piece was Adobe Premiere Pro.
