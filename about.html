<div id="me"> My name is Steven Ly, aka stevebutu for an online name. I always wanted to create video edits and aesthetically-pleasing photographs ever since I was a child. After my dad giving me a simple disposable camera, I was always captivated to keep my drive going with the excitement of capturing memories with a single shot, which developed my little burning passion of finding what I wanted to do. Born and raise in San Jose, California, I come from a Vietnamese family that lives in the suburbs that had only the idea of becoming a doctor or a lawyer growing up. I had no idea what art was completely about. Even when I reached high school, I had no clue what my passion really was. I had many interests within the art field, but I was majorly embedded in Digital Art, things like photography or videos online I saw on social media platforms. It was not until I found out about Digital Media Art, my first year of San Jose State University. My friend told me it is a field where it resembles me most, so I decided to progress my way to it. At first, I thought that I was an oddball for picking a career path where no one in my family was following. Still, I realized that I was not alone until I came to grow up and see that it is all about meeting new people with similar interests and doing what you love. I really wanted to improve my skills and nourish the moments while I progress through these learning phases. I wanted to create these art types because I want the world to know my perspective of what I am sharing. Whether it is from a photo or video, I want the person to understand the message displayed through my artwork; complex or simple. The thought of creating a project and having it published always seems to push me to put out more artwork. My early path to becoming an artist focused on the field of photography and video editing. My mind constantly had been around the car or gaming scene. Art related to a nightlife feeling with the mixture of Japanese Deported Model of cars, I was mesmerized by Japan’s visual aesthetics. The cultural difference of how the environments are completely utterly beautiful in their own ways gave me this burning passion for revolving my work around it. Continuing my college journey, I learned many techniques that allow me to see the potential I had in other mediums such as casting molds, coding websites, or artwork. My passion for displaying my artwork revolving around the Japanese aesthetic was slowly fading as my school life transitioned to online classes. My motivation to what I had thought would be great to present to fellow peers in person had been deemed to be only online. The restrictions of going outside took the downside of me, but I thought to myself, what can I do to show myself in my art pieces even when I’m not there in person? Then it hit me as hard as I saw the news on my social media platform feed. “Asian Americans hate crime rates reaching higher than ever before.” Yet no one heard the voice in the dark that was calling for help. I saw the ridiculous number of articles that talked about attacks specifically targeting my community, but there was no light to shine on it from mainstream media. I slowly progressed my art mind to the concepts of breaking silence to hate crime, specifically towards Asian Americans. The thought of having to see this news be reported nearly every day and minute popped in my head that it could be anyone’s parent or even grandparent. My inner passion seems to rise when I see news articles ignored by many news outlets and shunned, making my transition to a call to action and lifelong goal to give voice to injustices.
