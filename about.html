<div id="bio"> My name is Steven Ly. aka stevebutu for an online name. I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I always wanted to create video edits and aesthetically-pleasing photographs ever since I was a child.
  I want to improve my skills and nourish the moments while I progress through these learning phases. I create these types of art because I want the world to know my perspective of what I am sharing.
  Whether it is from a photo or video, I want the person to understand the message displayed through my artwork; complex or simple. The thought of creating a project and having it published
  always seems to push me to put out more artwork. Iâ€™m slowly progressing to concepts of breaking silence to hate crime, specifically towards Asian Americans. My inner passion seems to rise when I
  see news articles ignored by many news outlets and shunned, making my transition to a call to action.
