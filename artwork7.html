      <div id="bio">"Trip In My Days" is a project where I decided to tell my high school memory in a narrative. This was over the summer, and I decided to reminisce
      some of the memories and feelings I had during high school. This photo was the last part of Highschool that I had with my friends before everyone went in different directions. Hopefully, when the
      audience observes this piece after reading the context, they can remember their own memories of them in high school.
      The piece was made with Adobe Photoshop 2020 and Sony Vegas Pro 14.
